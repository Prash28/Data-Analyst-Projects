**Project Performance Dashboard**

Hi, in this activity, I have tried to create a Excel Dashboard based on the performance of a certain project using the various data available.
I created this dashboard with help of the Youtube video from **"Kenji Explains"**.

Link to the video: [Here](https://youtu.be/TrhvO5-Jum8?si=Lmq-3Z9UZZmE5AyE).

**The various Metrics which the dashboard will display are:**
1. Project Timeline/Roadmap (using Gantt Chart)
2. Sales by Country (using a Trend Line chart)
3. Satisfaction scores of Customers and Employees (both using gauge charts)
4. Budget vs Actual Expenses (using Column chart)
5. Staff Turnover (using Waterfall Chart)
 
**Charts learnt making this dashboard:**
1. Gantt Chart
2. Gauge Chart
3. Column Chart
4. Waterfall Chart

Please take a look at the dashboard in the excel sheet or below screenshots.
