**Adidas Sales Performance Dashboard**

Hi, in this activity, I have tried to create a performance Dashboard based on the sales made by Adidas in the years 2020 and 2021.
I created this dashboard with help of the Youtube video from **"Kenji Explains"**.

Link to the video: [Here](https://youtu.be/5eLtjO2Hfs0?si=wzbLyaCuGxPMHUzh).

Please take a look at the dashboard in the excel sheet or below sscreenshots.

This dashboard will contain filters based on which all the charts present in the dashboard will change.

**Skills learnt making this dashboard:**
1. Pivot tables
2. Excel charts
3. Excel formulas

(When no filter is used and the whole data is visualized)\

(Sales Performance of the regions South, Southeast and West is viewed for both the years 2020 and 2021 without adding any filters to the type of product)\
